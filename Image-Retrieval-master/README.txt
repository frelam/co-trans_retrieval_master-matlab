Built a working application with basic GUI that performs a sketch to image search i.e given a drawn sketch, find all the closest images.Done using HOG descriptor as features. 

code_invariant_alltrain.m computes the feature descriptor of all the images. 
scale_test.m , scale_test_similarity.m compute the similarity between the feature descriptors. 
final_alltrain.m is the main file.
